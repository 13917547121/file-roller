== ToDo ==

[x] optimization of the add_folder operation: if the command supports all the
    requested options add the folder directly instead of reading the folder 
    and adding the content in chunks.
    
    Partially fixed for the commands that allow to specify the file list
    in a file, that is: tar, rar, 7zip.
    
[ ] #525274 – File roller seems to be unable to create zipfiles without .zip extension

[ ] #512825 – Fails extraction of files within directories named '.'

[ ] #508737 – can't add file to the archive if archive name is without extension

[ ] #482560 – totem-like plugin installer for file-roller

[x] #153281 – Progress bar should be exact

    This is command dependent: fixed for tar, zip, 7zip, rar.

[x] #504584 – Incorrect comportment when extracting multi part rar files

[x] LP:#186921 – Asking for password with missing archive volume

[ ] #543225 – File-Roller is unable to open gzip-compressed files like pci.ids if they are missing an .gz extension

== Done ==

[x] #521324 – ALZ archive support

[x] #343201 – Use p7zip for RAR archives?

[x] #529395 – file-roller will not open 256 AES zip files
    --> use 7z for zip archives (see #515194 – PK 4.5 Zip files).

[x] #520844 – File roller not cancelling compression

[x] #519046 – add x-cbr and x-cbz support

[x] implement the tree_view context menu commands.

[x] Add with wildcard.
	Add with wildcards options :
	1) Include sub-directories.
	2) Ignore directories that are symbolic links.
	3) If the selection is "*" --> ignore backup files.

[x] Drag & Drop.

Other archive formats:

[x]	rar
[x]	lha
