== DONE == 

[x] optimization of the add_folder operation: if the command supports all the
    requested options add the folder directly instead of reading the folder 
    and adding the content in chunks.
    
    Partially fixed for the commands that allow to specify the file list
    in a file, that is: tar, rar, 7zip.
    
[x] #153281 – Progress bar should be exact

    This is command dependent: fixed for tar, zip, 7zip, rar.

[x] #503940 – Various Archive Manager documentation mistakes
